##Chapter 2 Math and Variables

We are going to use python like a calculator.  At the same time, we will learn about numbers.  We will also learn about variables.

**<< Read chapter 2 >>**

Here are some of the operators in python

* Plus +
* Minus -
* Multiply *
* Divide /

```print(((5 + 30) * 20) / 10)```

Now let's cover assignment and variables.  Variables are labels used to tag information.  I like to think of a variable as a box.  When you assign the variables, you temporarily put something in the box.  Later you can look at what is in the box, or put something different in the box.  Itâ€™s a useful way to organize your program and keep track of the work that you have done in your program.
